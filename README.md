<br><br>
The data used in this project comes from a kaggle comptition that attempts to predict hourly electricity meter readings for different buildings situated at different sites using different electricity meters.
Data for 2016 has been provided as Training Dataset and Test Dataset comprises of data from 2017 and 2018 for 1000+ buldings.
**The organisation wants to make some improvements to the buildings so that buildings become energy efficient.**

The **GOAL** of this competition is to create best models that can accurately **predict meter readings for coming years if there were no improvements/changes made.** So that best comparisons can be made with actual meter readings obtained after applying the improvements. That is why the test set is doublt the size of train set.
This would help organisation to show case their products and their performances to **attract large scale investors and financial institutions to invest in this area** to enable progress in building efficiencies.

**Attributes of this Project** <br>
Competition makes it a very challenging and interesting Machine Learning Regression Project as it:

- Contains huge amont of data (More than 60 Million Rows).Handling which is itself a challenging task
- Requires lots of EDA
- Involves processing time series data
- Lots of Missing Data
- Requires feature engineering
- As it is a featured competition, It has quite complicated data, so handling this requires lots of analytical and rational sense.
- All Regression Models can be tested and applied for better results.
- The techniques necessary to work with this data are applicable to many other types of Machine Learning problems.
